## 🤔 What Is This?

This project turns your **Windows desktop into a fully interactive productivity operating system**. Instead of a static wallpaper, your desktop shows a live Next.js web app — complete with animated widgets, a real database, and full interactivity — rendered inside [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) using its built-in WebView2 (Chromium) engine.

### Why is this impressive technically?

- **No cloud. No subscriptions. 100% offline-first.** All data lives in a local SQLite file on your machine.
- **Survives reboots.** A custom VBS startup script silently launches the Next.js server in the background before Windows even loads your desktop. By the time you see your wallpaper, the server is already running.
- **Multi-profile.** Switch between completely isolated user profiles, each with their own tasks, notes, health history, stats, and preferences.
- **Persistent state across WebView2 sessions.** Lively Wallpaper's WebView2 engine wipes `localStorage` on every reload. We solved this by building a custom Zustand storage adapter that writes state to the SQLite database via a REST API instead.
- **Locked Wallpaper Memory.** You can pin any specific wallpaper so it always loads on boot, ignoring the slideshow cycle — with that preference stored in the database, surviving reboots.

<a id="setup"></a>
## ⚡ Automated 1-Click Setup

> **You do NOT need to be a developer to use this.** The setup script handles everything.

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or 11
- An active internet connection (for the first-time install only)
- [Lively Wallpaper](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntm2qc6qws7) (Free on the Microsoft Store)

### Steps

1. **Download** this repository as a ZIP file and **extract it** to a permanent location on your PC.  
   *(Recommended: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\ProductiveDashboard`)*

2. **Right-click `setup.bat`** → **Run as Administrator**

3. The script will automatically:
   - ✅ Check for and install Node.js if missing
   - ✅ Run `npm install` to download all dependencies
   - ✅ Generate the Prisma client and set up the SQLite database
   - ✅ Create a `.env` file with the correct database path
   - ✅ Build the production-optimized Next.js bundle
   - ✅ Create `start-server.vbs` — a silent script that starts the server with zero console windows
   - ✅ Create `start-lively.vbs` — a silent script that opens Lively Wallpaper with a delay
   - ✅ Register **two Task Scheduler tasks** to auto-run both scripts at login with Administrator privileges and auto-retry on failure

4. **Restart your PC.** The dashboard will be live at `http://localhost:4321` before you even open a browser.

---

<a id="lively"></a>
## 🎨 Connecting to Lively Wallpaper

Once the server is running at `http://localhost:4321`:

1. Open **Lively Wallpaper** from your Start Menu or System Tray
2. Click the **`+` (Add Wallpaper)** button
3. Select **"Enter URL / Web"**
4. Type: `http://localhost:4321`
5. Press Enter and apply it as your wallpaper

Your desktop is now a live, interactive productivity dashboard. All clicks, drags, and interactions work directly on the desktop.

<a id="features"></a>
## 🎯 All Features Deep-Dive

### 🎥 Dynamic Video & Image Wallpapers

The background of the dashboard is fully dynamic — not a static image.

- Supports **`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`** formats
- Ships with **9 bundled default wallpapers** (Naruto, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Demon Slayer, Itachi, and more)
- **Upload your own**: Go to `Settings → Wallpapers → Upload Media`
- **Hide/Show**: Default wallpapers can be hidden from the cycle without deleting them
- **Slideshow Mode**: Auto-cycles through visible wallpapers at 1, 5, 10, 30, or 60 minute intervals
- **Lock Wallpaper**: Click any wallpaper in Settings to permanently pin it as your active background — it persists across reboots. Enabling slideshow or clicking "Next" clears the lock automatically
- **Video Controls**: Play/Pause and Mute/Unmute buttons appear when a video wallpaper is active

**Technical note:** Media files are served through a custom `/api/media` streaming route with proper HTTP range request support (206 Partial Content), which is required for video seeking to work correctly in WebView2.

---

### ⏰ Big Animated Clock

- Displays current time in a large, beautiful format
- Supports **12-hour (AM/PM)** and **24-hour military** format — toggle in Settings
- Fully **draggable**: click and drag to reposition on any wallpaper
- Position is **saved per-wallpaper** — different wallpapers can have the clock in different spots
- Lock/unlock dragging from `Settings → Preferences → Lock Clock`

---

### 💪 Health Rings (Apple Watch Style)

Inspired by Apple's Activity Rings, these animated circles track 5 daily habits:

| Ring | Habit | Target |
|---|---|---|
| 💧 | Water Intake | 8 glasses/day |
| 🧘 | Stretching/Exercise | 1 session/day |
| 📚 | Reading | 30 min/day |
| 🎓 | Academic Study | 2 hours/day |
| 🗣️ | English Practice | 1 session/day |

- Click any ring to **log progress** — the ring fills up with a smooth animation
- At **midnight**, rings auto-reset and the day's data is archived to the database
- Historical data is viewable in the **Stats Modal**
- Data is stored separately per profile and per date in the `HealthRecord` SQLite table

---

### ⏱️ Focus Timer (Pomodoro-Style)

A persistent, full-featured session timer:

- Set any custom duration in minutes
- Supports **start, pause, resume, and cancel**
- **Survives page refreshes**: timer state (`endAt` timestamp, `pausedLeft` milliseconds) is stored in Zustand and persisted to SQLite — reload the page and your timer picks up exactly where it left off
- Plays an **alarm sound** when time runs out
- Integrates with the **Task Manager** — start a timer directly from a task card
- Auto-deducts completed time from the task's estimated duration

---

### ✅ Task Manager

A clean, focused to-do list:

- Add tasks with a **title** and **estimated duration** in minutes
- Mark tasks as **complete** (with a satisfying strikethrough animation)
- **Delete** individual tasks
- **Start a timer** directly from a task — opens the focus timer pre-loaded with that task's duration
- All tasks persist in Zustand/SQLite and survive reboots

---

### 📝 Notes Manager (Rich Text Journal)

A multi-notebook rich text editor:

- Create **multiple separate notebooks**
- Each notebook stores **date-stamped entries** — write a note today, come back tomorrow and it auto-creates a new entry for that date
- Notes use a **contenteditable rich text** interface with basic formatting
- Entries with no content are automatically removed to keep notes clean
- All notebooks and entries persist in the main `DashboardStorage` table as JSON

---

### 🗺️ Plans & Roadmap Manager

A full learning/project roadmap tracker:

- Create **Plans** with a title, category, estimated duration, and target end date
- Add **Sub-Topics** to each plan — granular milestones
- Check off sub-topics as you complete them — visual progress bar updates in real-time
- Add a **thumbnail image** to each plan (compressed and stored as base64)
- Plans are great for tracking things like "Learn DSA", "Build Portfolio", "IELTS Prep", etc.

---

### 📅 Timetable

A weekly class/work schedule grid:

- **7-day × 9-timeslot** editable grid (Monday–Sunday, 9 AM–5 PM)
- Click any cell to edit the subject/activity for that time slot
- Pre-filled with a sample CS student schedule
- Persists in the main store

---

### ⏳ Target Countdowns

3 customizable countdown timers displayed on the desktop:

- Set a **title** and **target date** for each
- Shows days remaining in a clean format
- Updates in real-time
- Perfect for: Exam dates, project deadlines, travel plans, etc.

---

### 📅 Mini Calendar

- A compact month view showing the current month
- Today's date is highlighted
- Navigate between months
- Purely informational — great for a quick date reference at a glance

---

### 💬 Motivational Quotes Engine

An intelligent daily quote system:

- **100+ hand-curated quotes** covering productivity, stoicism, focus, and growth
- **Anti-repetition memory**: tracks recently shown quotes in a session — you won't see the same quote twice in a row
- Quotes are displayed with smooth fade animations on the wallpaper

---

### 📊 Stats & History

A visual history of your study/work sessions:

- Tracks total minutes worked **per day** (auto-logged when you complete focus timer sessions)
- Displays a **bar chart** of your last 30 days of activity
- Great for building streaks and visualizing consistency

---

### 🔗 Navbar (Quick Launch Icons)

A sleek top navigation bar with one-click launchers for:

- **WhatsApp** — opens your WhatsApp Web
- **Telegram** — opens Telegram Web
- **VS Code** — launches Visual Studio Code via the `vscode://` protocol
- **Antigravity** — links to the AI coding assistant
- All links open in new windows/tabs to avoid disrupting the wallpaper WebView2 session

---

<a id="state"></a>
## 🧠 State Management Architecture

The state management is one of the most technically interesting parts of this project, specifically built to solve the **Lively Wallpaper / WebView2 localStorage wipe problem**.

### The Problem

Lively Wallpaper uses WebView2 (Chromium-based) to render the web app. Every time the wallpaper reloads (screen lock, reboot, Lively restart), WebView2 wipes all `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Standard Zustand persistence to `localStorage` doesn't survive reboots.

### The Solution: Custom SQLite-Backed Storage Adapter

We created a custom Zustand storage adapter (`fileStorage` in `dashboardStore.ts`) that:

1. **On `getItem`**: Fetches the current state from `/api/store` (SQLite) via a `GET` request. Falls back to `localStorage` only if the API is unreachable (e.g., server offline).

2. **On `setItem`**: POSTs the new state to `/api/store` (SQLite) on every state change. Falls back to `localStorage` only on API failure.

3. **On `removeItem`**: POSTs `null` data to `/api/store` to clear the profile's stored state.

```typescript
const fileStorage = createJSONStorage(() => ({
  getItem: async (_name) => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/store?profileId=${getActiveProfileId()}`);
    const json = await res.json();
    if (json.data === null) return null; // New profile → use defaults
    if (json.data) return JSON.stringify(json.data);
    return localStorage.getItem(`dashboard-storage-${getActiveProfileId()}`); // Fallback
  },
  setItem: async (_name, value) => {
    await fetch('/api/store', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ profileId: getActiveProfileId(), data: JSON.parse(value) }),
    });
  },
  // ...
}));
```

### What Gets Persisted vs. What Doesn't

The `partialize` config **excludes** transient UI state from being saved:

```typescript
partialize: (state) => Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(state).filter(([key]) => ![
    'isQuotePopupOpen', 'isTaskManagerOpen', 'isStatsOpen', 'timerTrigger',
    'isNotesOpen', 'isPlansOpen', 'isTimetableOpen', 'isHealthModalOpen', 'healthData',
    'isVideoMuted', 'isVideoPlaying', 'isSettingsOpen'
  ].includes(key))
),
```

Everything else — tasks, notes, plans, wallpaper preference, widget positions, timer state, clock format, countdowns, visibility toggles, locked wallpaper — is saved to SQLite on every change.

---

<a id="wallpaper-system"></a>
## 🖼️ Wallpaper & Background System

The background system (`VideoBackground.tsx`) is reactive and intelligent:

1. **On mount**: Fetches the list of all wallpapers from `/api/wallpapers`
2. **Filtering**: Reactively filters out any wallpapers in the `hiddenWallpapers` list from Zustand (fixes the issue where hidden wallpapers would reappear after a reboot due to async hydration timing)
3. **Locked Wallpaper Logic**: If `lockedWallpaper` (a filename string) is set in the store, that specific wallpaper is always shown regardless of the current `bgIndex`
4. **Slideshow**: If slideshow is enabled, an interval fires every N minutes to call `cycleBackground()`, which increments `bgIndex` and clears `lockedWallpaper` automatically
5. **Fallback**: If all wallpapers are hidden, falls back to `naruto.webp`
6. **Event-driven updates**: Listens for a `wallpapers-updated` custom DOM event dispatched by SettingsModal after uploads/deletes/visibility changes — triggers a fresh re-fetch

---

<a id="startup"></a>
## 🚀 Automated Startup System

The dashboard uses a two-script VBScript system to start silently on Windows boot:

### `start-server.vbs`
```vb
' Starts Next.js production server completely invisibly (no console window)
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "cmd /c cd /d ""C:\path\to\dashboard"" && npm run start", 0, False
```

### `start-lively.vbs`
```vb
' Waits 15 seconds for the server to start, then opens Lively Wallpaper
WScript.Sleep 15000
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run """C:\path\to\Lively.exe""", 0, False
```

Both scripts are registered as **Windows Task Scheduler tasks** with:
- Trigger: **At user logon**
- Run with **highest privileges** (Administrator)
- Auto-restart on failure: **3 retries, 1 minute apart**
- Run whether or not user is logged on

<a id="persistence"></a>
## 🔒 Data Persistence & Reboot Safety

| Data Type | Storage Location | Survives Reboot? |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks, Notes, Plans | SQLite via `/api/store` | ✅ Yes |
| Health Records | SQLite `HealthRecord` table | ✅ Yes |
| Widget Positions (per wallpaper) | SQLite via `/api/store` | ✅ Yes |
| Locked Wallpaper Preference | SQLite via `/api/store` | ✅ Yes |
| Hidden Wallpapers List | SQLite via `/api/store` | ✅ Yes |
| Active Profile ID | `localStorage` (persists in WebView2 across sessions) | ✅ Yes |
| Timer State (`endAt`, `pausedLeft`) | SQLite via `/api/store` | ✅ Yes |
| Uploaded Wallpaper Files | `/public/wallpapers/` folder on disk | ✅ Yes |
| Modal open/closed states | In-memory Zustand only | ❌ No (intentional) |

---

<a id="profiles"></a>
## 👥 Multi-Profile System

The dashboard supports multiple completely isolated user profiles ("Workspaces"):

- **Profile 1 (Default)** is created automatically and cannot be deleted
- Create additional profiles in `Settings → Workspaces → Create New Workspace`
- Switching profiles **reloads the page** — the new profile's data is fetched fresh from SQLite
- Each profile has its own:
  - Tasks, Notes, Plans, Timetable
  - Health history
  - All preferences (clock format, widget visibility, widget positions, etc.)
  - Slideshow settings and wallpaper preferences
- Deleting a profile permanently removes all its data (except uploaded media files, which are shared)
- Active profile ID is stored in `localStorage` under `dashboard-active-profile`

<a id="quirks"></a>
## 🕵️ Known Quirks & Pro Tips

### Lively Wallpaper Focus Bug
Lively Wallpaper occasionally loses mouse focus when you click heavily on the desktop or switch between apps. **If a button isn't responding**, click an empty area on the desktop first (to give Lively focus), then click your target button. This is a known Lively/WebView2 limitation, not a bug in this app.

### First Boot Delay
On the very first boot after running `setup.bat`, the Task Scheduler task takes ~5-20 seconds to start the server. If you see your wallpaper loading as a plain Next.js error screen, wait 15-20 seconds and it will resolve itself.

### Video Wallpaper Autoplay
Browsers require user interaction before playing audio. When a video wallpaper first loads, it auto-plays muted (to satisfy browser autoplay policies), then restores your saved mute preference immediately after. This causes a brief "muted then unmuted" flash — it's expected behavior.

### Widget Dragging
- Widgets must be **unlocked** in `Settings → Preferences → Widget Layout` to be draggable
- Positions are saved **per wallpaper** — changing your wallpaper will load positions you set specifically for that background
- Use "Reset Default Positions" in Settings to return all widgets for the current wallpaper to their original positions

## 👨‍💻 Author

**Gonaboyina Anand Kumar**

This project started as a personal productivity experiment and grew into a full-featured desktop operating system. The **complete concept, product vision, feature design, and architecture decisions are entirely my own** — from the idea of running a Next.js app as a live wallpaper, to solving the WebView2 localStorage wipe problem, to the multi-profile system and wallpaper locking.

The implementation was built with the assistance of **[Antigravity AI](https://antigravity.dev)** as an AI pair-programming tool, which helped accelerate writing component logic, API routes, and boilerplate code. This is similar to how a developer uses GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to move faster — the thinking, the decisions, and the understanding remain mine. I have a working knowledge of full-stack web development (MERN stack, REST APIs, React state management, database design) and understand how each part of this project functions.
